Added ability to see yesterday's activities

# Bugs Removed
- Entering a non-int value at the select id stage broke the program. Added exception handling there. 
- Corrected spelling in a few UI text prompt places

# Usability improvements
- Frequently found myself wanting for a way to look at yesterday's activities. Now you can by typing `b-1` into selection area. Previously `b` started your today, now hidden option of `b-1` which launches yesterday's activities to reschedule etc.
