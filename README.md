Simple task manager where the focus is on the time allocated for each task. This is how it works:

- Every time you create a new task, you assign the amount of time you think it will take and then when you are ready for the task, start the timer. 
- When the timer runs out a rooster crowing sound (that will eventually be modifiable) will play, post which you have the option of marking the task as completed.
- You also have the option of duplicating the task to the next day if it is incomplete or adding time.
- You can also add details like the context that you came up with the task, and notes about the task for reference.
